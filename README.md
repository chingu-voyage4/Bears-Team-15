### Our project

In this voyage we are aiming to create a Flashcards application.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard), flashcards are
> cards bearing information, as words or numbers, on either or both sides, used in study. One writes a question on a side and an answer overleaf.
>
> Flashcards can bear vocabulary, historical dates, formulae or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. Flashcards are widely used to aid memorization.
